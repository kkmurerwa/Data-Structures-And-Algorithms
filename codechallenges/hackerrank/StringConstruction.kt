/**
 * String Construction
 *
 * Amanda has a string of lowercase letters that she wants to copy to a new string. She can perform the following operations with the given costs. She can perform them any number of times to construct a new string :
 *
 * Append a character to the end of string  at a cost of  dollar.
 * Choose any substring of  and append it to the end of  at no charge.
 * Given  strings , find and print the minimum cost of copying each  to  on a new line.
 *
 * For example, given a string , it can be copied for  dollars. Start by copying ,  and  individually at a cost of  dollar per character. String  at this time. Copy  to the end of  at no cost to complete the copy.
 *
 * Function Description
 *
 * Complete the stringConstruction function in the editor below. It should return the minimum cost of copying a string.
 *
 * stringConstruction has the following parameter(s):
 *
 * s: a string
 * Input Format
 *
 * The first line contains a single integer , the number of strings.
 * Each of the next  lines contains a single string, .
 *
 * Constraints
 *
 * Subtasks
 *
 *  for  of the maximum score.
 * Output Format
 *
 * For each string  print the minimum cost of constructing a new string  on a new line.
 *
 * Sample Input
 *
 * 2
 * abcd
 * abab
 * Sample Output
 *
 * 4
 * 2
 * Explanation
 *
 * Query 0: We start with  and .
 *
 * Append character '' to  at a cost of  dollar, .
 * Append character '' to  at a cost of  dollar, .
 * Append character '' to  at a cost of  dollar, .
 * Append character '' to  at a cost of  dollar, .
 * Because the total cost of all operations is  dollars, we print  on a new line.
