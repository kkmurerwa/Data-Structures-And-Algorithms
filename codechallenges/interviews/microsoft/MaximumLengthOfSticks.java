/**
 * There are two wooden sticks of lengths A and B respectively. Each of them can be cut into shorter sticks of integer
 * lengths. Our goal is to construct the largest possible square. In order to do this, we want to cut the sticks in such
 * a way as to achieve four sticks of the same length (note that there can be some leftover pieces). What is the longest
 * side of square that we can achieve?
 * Write a function:
 * class Solution â€¹ public int solution(int A, int B); }
 * that, given two integers A, B, returns the side length of the largest square that we can obtain. If it is not
 * possible to create any square, the function should return 0.
 * Examples:
 * 1. Given A = 10, B = 21, the function should return 7. We can split the
 * second stick into three sticks of length 7 and shorten the first stick by 3.
 * 2. Given A = 13, B = 11, the function should return 5. We can cut two sticks
 * of length 5 from each of the given sticks.
 * 3. Given A = 2, B = 1, the function should return 0. It is not possible to
 * make any square from the given sticks.
 * 4. Given A = 1, B = 8, the function should return 2. We can cut stick B into
 * four parts.
 * Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:
 * * A and B are integers within the range [1..1,000,000000).
