/**
 * There are two candy shops, both of which have N candies for sale. The first shop sells each candy for one golden
 * coin; the second shop sells each candy for one silver coin. You have N/2 golden coins and N/2 silver ones (Nis even).
 * Each candy is of some particular type (not necessarily unique), represented by an integer. What is the maximum number
 * of different types of candy that you can buy?
 * Write a function:
 * class Solution { public int solution (int[] A, int[] B); }
 * that, given two arrays A and B of N integers, representing types of candies in the first and second shop respectively,
 * returns the maximum possible number of different types of candy that you can buy.
 * For example, given:
 * A = [1, 2, 3, 4]
 * B = [3, 3, 3, 71]
 * the function should return 4. You can, for example, buy candies of types 1, 2 in the first shop and then candies of
 * types 3, 7 in the second shop.
 * Given:
 * A = [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]
 * Ð² = [17, 4, 2, 5, 1, 2]
 * the function should also return 4. In the first shop you can only buy candies of type 2, but then you can buy three
 * candies of other types (for example, 7, 4 and 5) in the second shop.
 * Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:
 * Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:
 * * Nis an integer within the range [2.100,000];
 * * N is even;
 * * each element of arrays A and B is an integer within the range (1..1,000,000,000).
